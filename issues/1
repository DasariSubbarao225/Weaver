### Title: Enable Copilot Coding Agent for Full Commit Access

**Objective:**  
Enable and configure the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent to have full permissions and ability to make actual code changes (commits and pull requests) in the DasariSubbarao225/Weaver repository.

#### Steps:

1. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Set "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
   - Save changes

2. **Add Copilot Agent as Collaborator**
   - Go to Settings → Collaborators & Teams
   - Click “Add People”
   - Search for and add:  
     Copilot or copilot-swe-agent (GitHub App)
   - Assign at least Write permission (preferably Admin for full access)

3. **Check Branch Protection**
   - Go to Settings → Branches
   - If branch protection is active on main, under “Restrict who can push to matching branches,”  
     add the Copilot agent to the list of allowed actors (or disable restriction temporarily)

4. **Add Copilot Agent Workflow File**
   - In .github/workflows/, ensure a workflow file (example: copilot.yml) exists with:

     ```yaml
     name: Copilot Coding Agent
     on:
       pull_request:
         types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
       workflow_dispatch:
     jobs:
       copilot:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: github/copilot-coding-agent@v1
     ```

5. **Approve Workflows (First Time)**
   - Go to the Actions tab
   - Approve any pending “Copilot Coding Agent” workflow runs

6. **Verify Functionality**
   - Re-trigger your coding agent task  
     (e.g., "Implement backend server-side file-based storage and API for admin panel...")
   - Verify that new PRs include committed code changes, not just planning text

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Copilot agent can open PRs containing real code modifications in the repository
- No “plan-only” or “empty” PRs for dev tasks; changes are actual files/scripts/config as requested
- Workflow runs are visible, and no permission errors are present
